3. Date of data collection 
Data were not all collected at the same time. The dataset is the collation and extension of previous datasets compiled by Van der Walt et al. (2011) (historic collections) and more recent fossil collections by Smith and Botha-Brink (2014), Botha et al. (2020) and Viglietti et al. (2021).

4. Geographic location of data:
Cape Town and Johannesburg, South Africa. 

5. Information about funding sources that supported the collection of the data: 
Grainger Bioinformatics Center, Field Museum of Natural History.
Women’s Board, Field Museum of Natural History.
National Research Foundation of South Africa (NRF).
Genus Palaeosciences, South Africa.

METHODOLOGICAL INFORMATION

1. Description of methods used for collection/generation of data: 
The dataset is the collation and extension of previous datasets compiled by Van der Walt et al. (2011) (historic collections) and more recent fossil collections by Smith and Botha-Brink (2014), Botha et al. (2020) and Viglietti et al. (2021). All vertical sections in this study were measured to an accuracy of 0.2 m in the field using a Jacob staff and Abney level. Wherever possible, lithological units were followed out laterally for at least 50 m. The vertical sections were measured through as much of the Balfour Formation as possible, and either from the lower bounding contact of a recognized underlying lithostratigraphic unit (e.g., Oudeberg Member), or overlying lithostratigraphic unit (e.g., Katberg Formation).
2. Methods for processing the data: 
These fossils represent 115 species grouped into 19 stratigraphic bin intervals. Bin intervals represent correlative stratigraphic intervals defined by in the field documentation of lithostratigraphic units and their thicknesses, using formalised definitions (South African Committee for Stratigraphy, 1980). These lithostratigraphic metadata helped group fossil specimens at meter-level precision in the bin-interval framework and allowed for correllation between field locations.
3. Instrument- or software-specific information needed to interpret the data: 
Microsoft Excel.

5. People involved with sample collection, processing, analysis and/or submission: 
Viglietti, Pia A., Rojas, Alexis., Rosvall, Martin., Klimes, Brady., Angielczyk, Kenneth, D.

DATA-SPECIFIC INFORMATION FOR: Dataset 1
1. Number of variables: 11

2. Number of cases/rows: 1408

3. Variable List 
Bin Interval – a stratigraphic interval used for correlation of lithostratigraphy, and fossil specimens at meter level between vertical sections measured at field sites.
Section upper boundary (m) – The upper boundary in meters for a stratigraphic bin interval. 
Accession number – The name of fossil specimen which represents its storage location at a registered repository (ie., SAM-PK-Iziko Museum, Cape Town, BP-Evolutionary Studies Institute, Johannesburg, NMQR, National Museum, Bloemfontein).
Field number – Some specimens include a number given to them when collected in the field and before accessioning in the repository.
Province - A smaller territory that adds up to make a federation, such as the Republic of South Africa. South Africa has nine provinces: Western Cape, Northern Cape, Eastern Cape, Kwa-Zulu Natal, Free State, Northern Province, Gauteng, Mpumalanga and Limpopo.
Study site – The district location within the Province of the study site (i.e., the subdivision of a county or a town).
Farm location – The ranch or farm where the fossil was located. GPS coordinates of these farm locations can be retrieved from the Principal Investigator, or Viglietti et al. 2021.
Superorder, Clade, Genus and Species – Taxonomic rank used in biology to classify groups of biological organisms based on shared characteristics.
