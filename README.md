METHODOLOGICAL INFORMATION

4. Description of data: 
The dataset at the core of this investigations comprises vertebrate fossil specimens collected in South Africa's Karoo Basin, and housed at various local and international repositories. The fossils were collected at meter-level precision, spanning the Permo-Triassic Cistecephalus, Daptocephalus, Lystrosaurus declivis, and Cynognathus Assemblage Zones of South Africa's Beaufort Group (Karoo Basin). These data are the collation and extension of previous datasets compiled by Van der Walt et al. (2011) (historic collections) and more recent fossil collections by Smith and Botha-Brink (2014), Botha et al. (2020) and Viglietti et al. (2021). 

1408 fossil specimens in our dataset represent 115 species grouped into 19 stratigraphic bin intervals. Bin intervals represent correlative stratigraphic intervals defined by in the field documentation of lithostratigraphic units and their thicknesses, using vertical sections. All vertical sections in this study were measured to an accuracy of 0.2 m in the field using a Jacob staff and Abney level. Wherever possible, lithological units were followed out laterally for at least 50 m. The vertical sections were measured through as much of the Balfour Formation as possible, and either from the lower bounding contact of a recognized underlying lithostratigraphic unit (e.g., Oudeberg Member), or overlying lithostratigraphic unit (e.g., Katberg Formation). Formalised definitions of lithostratigraphic units by the South African Committee for Stratigraphy (1980) also assisted in defining lithostratigraphic units in the field. These lithostratigraphic metadata helped group fossil specimens at meter-level precision in the bin-interval framework used to test the Karoo Basin Assemblage Zone framework.

5. Variable List 
Number of variables: 11
Number of cases/rows: 1408
Bin Interval – a stratigraphic interval used for correlation of lithostratigraphy, and fossil specimens at meter level between vertical sections measured at field sites.
Section upper boundary (m) – The upper boundary in meters for a stratigraphic bin interval. 
Accession number – The name of fossil specimen which represents its storage location at a registered repository (ie., SAM-PK-Iziko Museum, Cape Town, BP-Evolutionary Studies Institute, Johannesburg, NMQR, National Museum, Bloemfontein).
Field number – Some specimens include a number given to them when collected in the field and before accessioning in the repository.
Province - A smaller territory that adds up to make a federation, such as the Republic of South Africa. South Africa has nine provinces: Western Cape, Northern Cape, Eastern Cape, Kwa-Zulu Natal, Free State, Northern Province, Gauteng, Mpumalanga and Limpopo.
Study site – The district location within the Province of the study site (i.e., the subdivision of a county or a town).
Farm location – The ranch or farm where the fossil was located. GPS coordinates of these farm locations can be retrieved from the Principal Investigator, or Viglietti et al. 2021.
Superorder, Clade, Genus and Species – Taxonomic rank used in biology to classify groups of biological organisms based on shared characteristics. 

6. Methods for processing the data
Nodelists for our bipartite networks are created using Tidyverse (jessesadler).
Network models (Viglietti, Gastaldo, Rubidge, Broom, Member, Formation) are optimised in Infomap.
